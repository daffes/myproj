This is an academic project which consists in creating an user interface to recreate/edit the Symbol Table of a binary file in the Elf format.

It may be used to help debug or reverse engineer stripped binaries.

It's being built on top of the pyelftools library created by Eli Bendersky and which can be found at https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pyelftools
