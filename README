This is an academic project which consists in creating an user interface to recreate/edit the Symbol Table of a binary file in the Elf format.

It may be used to help debug or reverse engineer stripped binaries.

It's being built on top of the pyelftools library created by Eli Bendersky and which can be found at https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pyelftools. This library can parse all the elf information of a file. The ideia is to add functionalities to modify and write back the modified Symbol table.

Example:

gcc simple.c -o simple
strip simple
python example.py simple out (can't change inplace for now)
chmod +x out
gdb out
   break main
   break f
   run
   step until the end...

The two addresses hardcoded in example.py are
based on a 32bits compilation.
You may need to fix those addresses by those 
found in the command "readelf -s simple"
before stripping the file
